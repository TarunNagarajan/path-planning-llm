# LLM-Powered Trajectory Prediction & Compression for Robotic Arm Path Planning 
This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for trajectory prediction and compression in robotic arm path planning. By fine-tuning an LLM (e.g., Phi-2) on trajectory sequence data, the model learns to predict future trajectory points and optimize path execution with GPU-accelerated PCA (via CuPy/RAPIDS cuML).
